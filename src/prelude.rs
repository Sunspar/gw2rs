//! The `gw2rs::prelude` module provides common functionality in an easy to consume package.
//! It's primary use is to quickly import the various data structures that are found throughout the
//! system in a single interface. The most common usage of this module is through a glob import,
//! which brings all of the structs in the library into visibility.
